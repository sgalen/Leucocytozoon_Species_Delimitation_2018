# Leucocytozoon_Species_Delimitation_2018

Files needed to analyze the data from Galen et al. (2018) Integrating coalescent species delimitation with analysis of host specificity reveals extensive cryptic diversity despite minimal mitochondrial divergence in the malaria parasite genus Leucocytozoon

The names used to label FASTA/phylogeny files in this repository are abbreviations of the gene names found in the paper:

atp = ATPase2
ddrp = RPB1
dpol = POLD1
impo = KPBN1
prp = PRPF6
sec24 = SEC24A
sf3 = SF3B1
